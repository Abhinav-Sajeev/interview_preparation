### **1. What is Django?**

**Answer:**
Django is a **high-level Python web framework** that allows rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.
It follows the **MVT (Model–View–Template)** architecture.

### **2. Explain the MVT architecture in Django.**

| Component    | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**    | Defines data structure (tables in database)   |
| **View**     | Handles business logic and processes requests |
| **Template** | Handles user interface (HTML files)           |

Example flow:

```
User Request → View → Model (DB) → View → Template → Response
```

---

### **3. What are Django models?**

**Answer:**
Models are Python classes that define the structure of database tables using Django’s ORM.

**Example:**

```python
from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```

---

### **4. What is ORM in Django?**

**Answer:**
ORM (**Object-Relational Mapper**) lets developers interact with the database using **Python objects** instead of raw SQL.

Example:

```python
Employee.objects.filter(age__gt=25)
```

This generates an SQL query behind the scenes.

---

### **5. What are Django views?**

**Answer:**
A view is a Python function or class that receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response.

**Example (Function-based view):**

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
```

---

### **6. What are Django templates?**

**Answer:**
Templates are HTML files that display data dynamically using template tags and variables.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Hello, {{ user.username }}!</h1>
```

---

### **7. What is a URLconf (URL configuration) in Django?**

**Answer:**
It maps URLs to views using the `urls.py` file.

**Example:**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('home/', views.home, name='home')
]
```

---

### **8. How do you connect Django with a database?**

**Answer:**
Database settings are defined in `settings.py`.

**Example (for SQLite):**

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

---

### **9. What is `manage.py`?**

**Answer:**
A command-line utility to interact with Django projects.
Used for tasks like running the server, migrations, and creating apps.

**Examples:**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### **10. What are migrations in Django?**

**Answer:**
Migrations are Django’s way of applying changes made to models (Python code) into the actual database schema.

**Commands:**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### **11. What are static files in Django?**

**Answer:**
Static files are files like **CSS, JS, and images** that don’t change often.

**Example configuration:**

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
```

In templates:

```html
{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'images/logo.png' %}">
```

---

### **12. What are media files in Django?**

**Answer:**
Media files are **user-uploaded files** (like profile pictures).

**Configuration:**

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

---

### **13. What are Django forms?**

**Answer:**
Django forms handle **HTML form creation**, **validation**, and **data saving**.

**Example:**

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Employee

class EmployeeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Employee
        fields = ['name', 'age']
```

---

### **14. Difference between `Form` and `ModelForm`.**

| Form                       | ModelForm                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Created manually           | Automatically created from model |
| No direct link to database | Linked to database model         |
| Used for custom forms      | Used for CRUD operations         |

---

### **15. What is the Django admin interface?**

**Answer:**
A built-in feature to manage models and database data via a browser.

To enable:

```python
# admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Employee

admin.site.register(Employee)
```

Then run:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

### **16. What is middleware in Django?**

**Answer:**
Middleware are hooks that process requests and responses globally.

**Examples:**
AuthenticationMiddleware, SessionMiddleware, CSRF protection.

**Custom Middleware Example:**

```python
class SimpleMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        print("Before view")
        response = self.get_response(request)
        print("After view")
        return response
```

---

### **17. How do you handle sessions in Django?**

**Answer:**
Django provides built-in session management using cookies or the database.

**Example:**

```python
def set_session(request):
    request.session['user'] = 'Abhinav'
    return HttpResponse("Session Set")

def get_session(request):
    user = request.session.get('user')
    return HttpResponse(user)
```

---

### **18. How do you handle authentication and authorization in Django?**

**Answer:**
Django has a built-in authentication system for users, groups, and permissions.

**Example:**

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# create user
user = User.objects.create_user(username='john', password='pass123')

# login view
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
user = authenticate(username='john', password='pass123')
if user:
    login(request, user)
```

---

### **19. What are signals in Django?**

**Answer:**
Signals allow components to communicate when certain events occur (e.g., after saving a model).

**Example:**

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Employee

@receiver(post_save, sender=Employee)
def after_save(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Employee saved:", instance.name)
```

---

### **20. What is the difference between Function-Based Views (FBV) and Class-Based Views (CBV)?**

| Feature     | Function-Based View                | Class-Based View              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Definition  | Written as simple Python functions | Written as Python classes     |
| Simplicity  | Easier for small apps              | Better for complex views      |
| Reusability | Hard to reuse                      | Highly reusable (with mixins) |

**Example (CBV):**

```python
from django.views import View
from django.http import HttpResponse

class HomeView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to CBV!")
```

✅ **Bonus Quick Questions:**

1. What is `settings.py`? → Main configuration file for the Django project.
2. What is `wsgi.py`? → Gateway interface for deploying Django apps on web servers.
3. What is the difference between `get()` and `filter()`?

   * `get()` returns a single object (raises error if not found)
   * `filter()` returns a queryset (empty if not found).
4. What is `QuerySet`? → A collection of database queries returned by ORM.
5. What is CSRF protection? → Security feature to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
