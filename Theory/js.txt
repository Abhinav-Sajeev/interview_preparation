1. var, let, const

var → old way, can be used anywhere in function (not block-scoped).
let → used inside blocks { }, can be changed.
const → also block-scoped but cannot be changed.

2. What is Hoisting?

JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top before running the code.
So, you can use a function before writing it.

3. What is a Closure?

A closure means a function can remember variables from the place where it was created.

4. What is this?

this refers to who is calling the function.

5. Function Declaration vs Expression

Declaration: normal function (hoisted).
Expression: function stored in a variable (not hoisted).

6. What is Prototypal Inheritance?

Objects can use properties from another object — like a template.

7. Prototype Chain

When JS looks for a property, it checks the object, then its prototype, and keeps going until null.
Shorter way to write functions.
They don’t have their own this.

9. Event Bubbling & Capturing

When you click, the event moves:
Capturing: from top (document) → target.

Bubbling: from target → top.
You can stop it with event.stopPropagation().


10. Event Delegation

Add one event listener to a parent instead of many children — checks event.target.
